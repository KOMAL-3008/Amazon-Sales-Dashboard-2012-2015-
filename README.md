# Amazon-Sales-Dashboard:-2012-2015

This comprehensive Amazon Sales Dashboard I created using Excel and Power BI, where I utilized data cleaning and data manipulation techniques to provide key insights from 2012 to 2015 sales data.

Key highlights include:-
Total Sales Projection: ₹12.64M, indicating expected revenue based on historical data.
Units Sold: 3788 units, representing the total number of products sold across various markets.
Returned Units: 1464 units, helping evaluate product return rates and customer satisfaction.
Key Performance Indicator (KPI):- 178K, reflecting an important metric for tracking business performance.

Sales Breakdown:-
By Region: Sales are visualized on a world map, with major regions like North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific showing significant sales volumes. Asia Pacific leads the market with 4.04M in sales, followed by Europe and USCA.
By Segment: Sales are divided into three primary segments—Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office—with the Consumer segment contributing the most (7M).
By Market: Asia Pacific and Europe dominate with strong market shares, reflecting the importance of these regions to Amazon’s global sales strategy.

Product Profitability:-
Top 5 Products by Profit: The highest profit came from Canon Imaging (₹25K), followed by Cisco Smart and Motorola Smartphones (₹17K each). This indicates that tech-related products are driving profitability.
Bottom 5 Products by Profit: Products such as Cubify Cube and Bevis Routers underperformed, generating negative profits, signaling areas for improvement or reconsideration.

Customer Profit Analysis:-
Top Customers: Customers like Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch generated the highest profits (₹8.7K and ₹8.5K, respectively), showing strong loyalty and purchasing power.

In creating this dashboard, I applied data_cleaning, data_manipulation, data_visualization, data_presentation and model_view techniques to ensure the data was accurate and insightful. The combination of Excel for initial data work and Power_BI for visualization allowed me to develop a detailed analysis that offers actionable insights into sales performance, product profitability, and market segmentation.

This project highlights my ability to handle datasets and extract valuable insights for business strategy
